# (*) Asterisk

Asterisk is a Web-based minimistic code editor written in CoffeeScript running on node.js with webSockets.

I made this editor because I want to make my own tools.
I put this out there in hopes that you find it usefull, and maybe contribute.

## Selling points

* *small and simple* you can mold it to your liking 
* *minimalism philosophy* no tabs, bars, panels just code.
* *web-based* host dev tools on one server access from anywhere
* *webSockets* real time and responsive
* MIT license

## Why webbased?

Every thing is moving to the web and I feel that programming will move there too. 
No longer are we confied to a single device but move freely between laptops, desktops and even tablets.
But the web moves with us.
You could have all your tools installed on a server and use VNC to access them. 
VNC is clunky and draw diley and jpeg artafacts are very garring.  
You could opt out to use ssh with vi or emacs. 
But then again just like VNC you need SSH client installed. 
I for one can't stand the input delay and the text mode graphics.  
I want nice fonts and beatuful colors. 
That is why I wrote this editor. 
Free of distractions easy to change to your liking.


## Under the hood

Asterisk devieds into two main parts: the server part asterisk.coffee and client.coffee.

### Client side.

On the client side you 5 major sections:

* the tokenizer
* the editor 
* command bars (find, replace, open, other commands)
* key input system 









## NO IE

Does not work in IE because the work arounds would make it too complex.
